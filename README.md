## Java Design Patterns

[![Maven CI](https://github.com/gazbert/java-design-patterns/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/gazbert/java-design-patterns/actions/workflows/maven.yml)

A cookbook of commonly used Java design patterns based on examples from: 

* "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" - Gamma et al
* "Head First Design Patterns" - Freeman et al
* "Java Design Pattern Essentials" - Tony Brevis

I'll be adding new patterns to the project on an ad-hoc basis.

Each pattern is contained in its own package - the package-info will provide more details and the Test class 
will demonstrate how to use it.

Any comments/bugs/better ways of doing things, send 'em my way.
